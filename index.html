                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p><i>
                        Jay Driving school has evolved over the past 10 years from vehicle importation, road construction; 
                        driving school set up to an Association with a wide array of mobility related products and services.
                        Founded in 1919, the role that Jay Driving school played in the formative years was critical to ensuring the 
                        interests of motorists in the country were safeguarded. Some of the critical roles Jay driving school played included: 
                        providing information on the purchase and maintenance of motor vehicles, set up of the first petrol depots in the country, 
                        and mapping of the roads. One of the milestones we are most proud of is that our founder, Galton Fenzi, was the
                        first to drive from Nairobi to Mombasa using the Riley 12/50 vehicle. This vehicle was donated to Jay Driving 
                        School Kenya to facilitate testing of road conditions in East Africa.<br><br>
                        By 1925 the membership of the association had grown to 2000, but the effects of the Second World War reduced the
                        membership to 1,189 by 1939 and 753 in 1946. To diversify its services, the association started operating a driving 
                        school in 1962 beginning with a single Ford Anglia. The idea was introduced by the late M.A.S Northcorte and other 
                        former British army men. Respected for its strictness, in depth curriculum and commitment to responsible driving Jay 
                        Driving school has become one of the most favoured driving schools on the continent. In the year 2000 Jay driving School 
                        Kenya completed the construction of it's million dollar headquarters comprising a highly equipped garage. At present 
                        the association has over 100,000 members and branch offices in all major towns countrywide. Internationally, 
                        Jay Driving School Kenya is affiliated with Federation International Automobile (FIA) which represents 
                        over 100 million motorists worldwide.</i>
